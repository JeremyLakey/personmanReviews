		<h2>Bad Memories</h2>
		<p>Monoploy has countless stories of tearing apart game night. Family members leave frustrated and flustered. I remember playing games of monoploy that last for 2 to 3 hours. The whole time I was losing due to bad luck. Dispite this, Monoploy is still played. In my honest opinion, Monoploy is bad. It's an awful board game. But
			it is important to understand why it is still outselling most other board games. How does an awful game stay relavent?</p>
		<h2>The High</h2>
		<p>Monopoly ends with one side completely destroying the other. No mercy. This is a good design choice, because the winner gets a high feeling. Crushing others is a natural part of games. Many gamers play games specifically for that feeling of power. Few games give players the feeling of being able to completely
			outpower your opponents. Dispite this being the saving design choice, Monopoly fails to make other proper design choices.</p>
		<h2>What Monopoly Teaches us</h2>
		<p>Why is Monopoly a bad game? Its pretty simply. The losers spend to much time playing. And sometimes, even the winner spends to much time playing. The win condition of Monopoly, eliminating other opponents, is very brutal. The way to eliminate opponents, is the opposite of brutal.
			It takes a long time to get a monopoly. It takes time to buy houses and hotels. It takes even more time for players to land on the spaces.</p>
