		<h2>The Game of Prestige</h2>
		<p>Chess is in a interesting place in society. On one hand, it is viewed as the ultimate game of wits. On the other, it is viewed as monotous and borning. How good of a board game is chess? Is it worth playing today with all these other boards games coming out?
			Why do people enjoy the game so much but others find it bland?</p>
		<h2>Skill Curves</h2>
		<p>The most postitive attribute of chess is complexity. Even computers lack a full understanding of the game. Grandmasters continue to learn, and enjoy to learn more about the game they have already mastered.
			Complexity is not always bad in a game. Especially the sublime complexity that comes from a handful of different pieces. When complexity is managable, it allows players to make interesting decisions. Yet there are always new things to try. </p>
		<h2>Decision Paralysis</h2>
		<p>Chess's complexity is not for everyone. Many players get stuck playing chess. Thier own minds unable to make a decision out of confusion and fraustration. This is commonly known
			as decision paralysis. Overcoming decision paralysis is hard because a player needs to learn. Learn takes time and is terrible at first.  </p>
		<h2>The Joy of learning</h2>
		<p>When a player starts to like learning, chess is an all consuming desire. It drives people to discussion, which inspires more learning. Which inspires more playing. Sparking a cycle of learning. The entire
			chess community is built on getting better. Chess is simply chess. It will always be a game with a global community of learning. Thou hard to get into, it is often a well loved journey by the honest player</p>
